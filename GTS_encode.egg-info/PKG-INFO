# Encoding Mangōpare sensors using ECCODES

## Installation
This installs the eccodes libraries and additional libraries needed such as numpy, pandas, xarray

`pip install -r requirements/default.txt`

`pip install -r requirements/extra.txt`

`python setup.py install`

## Example
``` python
from GTS_encode import GTS_encode_subfloat, GTS_encode_ship, GTS_encode_glider

file = "../test/MOANA_0058_434_230228081912_qc.nc"
centre_code = 69 # MetService Centre code from table Code Table C-11 69 -> Wellington (RSMC)
GTS=GTS_encode_subfloat(file, centre_code, upcast=True) #upcast True if only upcast is needed
```
or 
```python
GTS= GTS_encode_ship(file, centre_code, upcast=True)
```
or 
```python
GTS= GTS_encode_glider(file, centre_code, upcast=True)
```
```python
GTS.run()
```

## Encoding support for mangōpare sensors.

This encoding uses the toolbox developed by eccodes and it is adapted to encode mangōpare sensors using the template for Temperature and salinity profile observed by profile floats (315003) and the template to represent data derived from a ship based lowered instrument measuring subsurface seawater temperature, salinity and current profiles (315007).

## Index
### utils
Useful functions to support the encoding of mangōpare sensors
- **inflection_data** - Identification of inflection points
- **extract_upcast** - Extraction of upcast measurements
- **pres** - conversion of depth (m) to pressure (Pa)

### GTS_encode
Includes classes to encode the data into GTS/BUFR format. This codes are tailored for Mangōpare sensors format, changes might be needed if the format changes, but it should be straightforward. 

There are three classes: 
- **GTS_encode_subfloat**
- **GTS_encode_ship**
- **GTS_encode_glider**

### Notes 
- Mangōpare sensor has the depth in meters - this is converted to dbars then to Pa.
- Mangōpare provides the temperature in Celsius - this is converted to Kelvin.
